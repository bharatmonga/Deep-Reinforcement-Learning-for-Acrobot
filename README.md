# Deep-Reinforcement-Learning-for-Acrobot

This repository contains the code to implement deep reinforcement learning algorithm called Reinforce to swing up an acrobot.

Acrobot is a 2 rigid link system actuated at the elbow joint. It is shown below on the left. The goal of this project is to design a control stimulus (motor torque) which swings up the acrobot from downward position $(q_1 = 0, \ q_2 = 0)$ to upward inverted position $(q_1 = \pi, \ q_2 = 0)$ shown on the right.
